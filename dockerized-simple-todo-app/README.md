# Getting started
A mini dockerrized simple todo list manager that runs on Node.js project, from docker docs.

This repository is a sample application for users following the getting started guide at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/.

The application is based on the application from the getting started tutorial at https://github.com/docker/getting-started

Steps:
1. Get project files/repo
Clone the project repo from the cloud and confirm that it has all the required files and dependeincies.
2. Build the app's image
To build the image, you'll need to use a Dockerfile. 
* A Dockerfile is simply a text-based file with no file extension that contains a script of instructions. 
* Docker uses this script to build a container image.
